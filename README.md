# Website Summarization

**The website that I created is for a fake real estate company.  I decided to do 5 different pages that will showcase different features using the CSS and JAVASCRIPT technologies.  The Index page will be the starter page and all other pages can link from there.**

### CSS Features

1. I created a navigation menu  that collapses down as the page get smaller.  When I get to a certain small size, which is for mobile, the menu will transform into a hamburger button to control the menu navigation.
2. The elements within the website are set up with Flexboxes that will wrap text and images as the screen size is manipulated. 
3. I created a CSS animation on the services and properties pages that will have the images spin when they are hovered over.

### JAVASCRIPT Features 

1. I created a form on the Contact Us page.  This is a simple form which collects general information and a paragraph output.  Once the form is committed, you are taken to a THANK YOU page.  The information is not saved in a database or anything of that nature.
2. I also created a button for the navigation when viewing in mobile screen size that will show/hide the navigation buttons.

### Media Query

I decided to create 3 different media query CSS files.  

1. The small file holds most of the CSS code as I designed for mobile first.  
2. The medium size is for devices such as IPADS or other tablets.  
3. The large CSS file is for desktop monitors and such.
